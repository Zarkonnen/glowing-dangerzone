<h1>Dark Bibliometrics: Tracking fraud and incompetence in scientific publishing</h1>
<h2>A proposal for the <a href="http://2014.okfestival.org/programme/unfestival-an-unconference-at-okfestival/">OKFest 2014 UnFestival</a>.</h2>
<p>Big cases of falsified data and crooked peer review have come to light in the last few years. I would like to discuss the idea of a reputation metric for papers, authors, and journals based on closeness to "known bad" science.

I would provide a number of concrete examples and a basic proposal for such a metric.</p>
